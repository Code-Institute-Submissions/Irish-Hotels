## **UX**

## User Stories

#### 1. First Time User

- As a first time user, I want to easily find my way around the site and find what Im looking for quickly.
- As a first time user, I want to be able to see what the site is about, and also check for hotels in Ireland.
- As a First time user, I want to see if there are any links to the companys social media channels.


#### 2. Returning User

- As a returning user, I want to check on the the map of various locations in Ireland.
- As a returning user, I want to check on hotels in the Republic of Ireland.


#### Design

- I used the dark theme as i felt the hero image fit nicely on it.
- The font gothic was used as i felt it mixed nicely with the headers and looked good on the nav page. 
- The sans-serif font was used after as i felt it fit the purpose.


#### Strategy

My aim in the design was to keep the home page simplistic with a captivating image to get the users attention
immediately.I also wanted the user to be able to naviagte the site very easily and have it as user-friendly as possible.

#### Scope

For users, I wanted to provide them with a site easy to navigate.I also wanted a map for them to see Ireland
and check out where the best place for them to stay would be.

#### Structure

In the home page I wanted a image that would draw the attention of the user immediately. I also wanted a naviagation bar that is easily useable,
and can get you to the rest of the site without much effort.
In the about section I wanted to detail what the company is about and the site is about.
In the destination section I wanted to show the user places and hotels in Ireland.
In the footer of each page i wanted to have links to the companys social media accounts.

#### Surface

The hero image on the homescreen I felt worked well to promote the beautiful hotels,scenery we have here in Ireland.
 The color scheme I used was a dark theme as again I felt it blended nicely with the hero image and therefore I 
 stuck with that theme throughout.
